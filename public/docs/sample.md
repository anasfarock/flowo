# Getting Started with Flowo

Welcome to Flowo! This guide will help you get up and running with our automation platform in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Flowo account (sign up at [flowo.com](https://flowo.com))
- Basic understanding of automation workflows
- Access to the applications you want to automate

## Creating Your First Automation

### Step 1: Access the Dashboard

1. Log in to your Flowo account
2. Click on "Create New Automation" button
3. Select the type of automation you want to create

### Step 2: Configure Triggers

Triggers are the events that start your automation:

```
Trigger Types:
- Webhook
- Scheduled (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Manual trigger
- API call
```

### Step 3: Add Actions

Actions are what your automation will do when triggered:

- Send an email
- Update a database
- Create a task
- Send a notification

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple** - Begin with basic automations before building complex workflows
2. **Test Thoroughly** - Always test your automation with sample data
3. **Monitor Performance** - Check your automation logs regularly
4. **Document Your Work** - Keep notes on what each automation does

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Automation not triggering**

- Check that the trigger is properly configured
- Verify that the trigger event is actually occurring
- Review the automation logs for errors

**Issue: Actions not executing**

- Ensure all required fields are filled in
